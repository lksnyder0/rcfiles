Help me write a todo list for this project. Consider each of the numbered points as separte todo items. Each item might have sub items to provide additional context or initial direction instructions.
1. Add the AI tools I'm using to this repo. I want to make sure I have consistent AI tools across all my machines.
  - I want to backup my global claude instructions from each machine individually. This repo is shared across personal and work contexts and I need to have different global instructions in each context.
  - I want to backup my global serena configuration. I think this is fine to be shared for now. If there are any security considerations to be made here, bring them to my attention so I can decide what to do.
  - I want to backup my global context7 coonfiguration. I think this is fine to be shared for now. If there are any security considerations to be made here, bring them to my attention so I can decide what to do.
  - Add these tools to the list of tools used
  - Add a section to the README about my AI setup. Include the use of claude code and the installed mcp servers. Make note of what each mcp server provides.
2. Add a macos install script based on the archlinux script.
  - Match the style and structure of this script.
3. Update the test script to support both macos and archlinux.
